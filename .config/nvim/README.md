# Neovim Configuration

This is where I will put general notes and reminders about my neovim configuration.

## To-Do

- [ ] Make borders for LSP windows

## Plugins to Look Into

- [nvim-treesitter-context](): Look later
- [outline.nvim](https://github.com/hedyhli/outline.nvim): Shows a syntax based outline of a file. Will be good if I can control what it shows
- [vim-visual-multi](https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi): Multiple cursors
- [trouble.nvim](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim): Prints nicer diagnostics
- [fidget.nvim](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim): Nicer messages
- [smear-cursor.nvim](https://github.com/sphamba/smear-cursor.nvim): Animated cursor (purely visual)
